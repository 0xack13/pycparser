Misc
----

yacc optimization: 
- If parsetab.py/pyc doesn't exist in the path, the table will be reconstructed anyway, regardless of the optimize parameter
- If it does exist:
  - If optimize=True, the table will be loaded unconditionally
  - If optimize=False, the table will be loaded only if it's older than the grammar

lex optimization:
- If optimize=False, the lexical table is re-computed and is not saved to a lextab file
- If optimize=True:
  - If lextab.py/pyc exists in the path, it will be loaded unconditionally
  - If lextab.py/pyc doesn't exist, it will be created and loaded
